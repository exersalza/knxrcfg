# KnxrCfg
Just another key -> value config schema


This is a mix out of the default windows config "ini" and a json yaml variation

## basic structure (not concrete yet):

(Some wild category name)
// Some types are supportet some are not, gl finding out what are. Jk strings, int, map/dict, vector are supportet.
// but inline aren't, not yet
token="Some random Tokens"

coolVector=["a vector can have multiple types"]
// Hey it's called steve
coolObject={giveItAName: "Steve"}
